# VSCode DevRef

This DevRef is primarily split into two sections:

1. [Extensions](#extensions)

All extensions listed are for VSCode(duh!). I primarily work with Javascript, so a majority of the extensions listed will revolve around Javascript and its frameworks.

I have also listed a few extensions that are language agnostic and make the developer life a little more efficient.

2. [Shortcuts](#shortcuts)

The shortcuts listed are mostly default shortcuts. I try to refrain from setting custom shortcuts until they are absolutely necessary. More often that not, they are not!

## Extensions
